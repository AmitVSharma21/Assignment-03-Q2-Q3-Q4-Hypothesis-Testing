##Anova ftest statistics

A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.

Anova ftest statistics: Analysis of varaince between more than 2 samples or columns Assume Null Hypothesis Ho as No Varaince: All samples TAT population means are same

Thus Alternate Hypothesis Ha as It has Variance: Atleast one sample TAT population mean is different

## Chi2 contengency independence test

Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables (male-female buyer rations are similar across regions (does not vary and are not related) Thus Alternate Hypothesis as Ha: Dependence of categorical variables (male-female buyer rations are NOT similar across regions (does vary and somewhat/significantly related)

Inference: As (p-value = 0.6603) > (α = 0.05); Accept the Null Hypothesis i.e. Independence of categorical variables Thus, male-female buyer rations are similar across regions and are not related

## Chi2 contengency independence test

Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables (customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre) Thus, Alternative hypothesis as Ha Dependence of categorical variables (customer order forms defective % varies by centre)

Inference: As (p_value = 0.2771) > (α = 0.05); Accept Null Hypthesis i.e. Independence of categorical variables Thus, customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre.
